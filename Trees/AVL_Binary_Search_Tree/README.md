# Binary Search Tree AVL

The AVL binary search tree consists of an algorithm that balances the search tree so that the height of the subtrees is always close, avoiding long search paths. This balancing is done from a balancing factor, calculated by subtracting the height of the left subtree by the height of the right subtree, if this factor is equal to module of 2, the tree will be balanced.
